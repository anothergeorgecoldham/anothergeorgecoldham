## ~$ whoami?
:office: I am a Cloud Solution Architect specializing in the Microsoft Security Platform at [Microsoft ANZ](https://www.microsoft.com).

:family_man_woman_boy_boy: A proud dad of two energetic boys and husband to an incredibly patient wife. I'm a tech enthusiast, avid gamer, fantasy novel reader, camper, whiskey lover, and food connoisseur.

:yellow_heart: My passion lies in making a positive impact on the lives of those around me. I strive to leave every space—virtual or physical—better than I found it.

:headphones: Music fuels my creativity and keeps me grounded.

:pray: With half my career spent as an educator in IT Networking, Administration, and Security, I found immense joy in teaching and mentoring. I continue to seek opportunities to share knowledge, mentor peers, and inspire others.

:performing_arts: I’m eager to volunteer in environments where I can grow my skills while giving back to the community. My experience spans governance at a national level to organizing and managing volunteers and activities.

>“Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. **Impossible is nothing.**”
